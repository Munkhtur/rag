**Financial Crime Mitigation**

A financial crime involves illegal activities committed against property, often for personal gain. These crimes typically involve the unlawful transfer of property ownership and can take many forms. In the financial sector, common financial crimes include money laundering, terrorist financing, violations of international sanctions, corruption, fraud, embezzlement, forgery, and theft.

**What is Money Laundering?**

Money laundering is the process of disguising the origin, ownership, and purpose of money gained from illegal activities. The goal is to make "dirty" money appear "clean" so it can be used without suspicion.

**What is Terrorist Financing?**

Terrorist financing refers to the process of gathering, moving, or using funds to support terrorists, terrorist acts, or related activities, whether directly or indirectly.

**What is the Financing of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction?**

This refers to the financial support of activities related to the manufacture, use, sale, or purchase of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons of mass destruction, which are prohibited by both Mongolian laws and international treaties. Combating this form of financing is crucial for international safety and security. It is essential for the bank to detect and prevent any transactions that could fund the proliferation of such weapons.
